Antenna Pattern Format (.dat)
The provided antenna patterns are provided in .dat files, which consist of E(theta), and E(phi) components in magnitude (dB) and phase angle (degrees) format for each farfield point measured. The measurement setup is defined in the first row of the .dat file.
•	Number of Phi planes
•	Phi Start Angle
•	Phi Stop Angle
•	Normalisation (dB)
•	Pattern Frequency (MHz)
Each row after the first consists of the theta angle for the measurement, E(theta) magnitude, E(theta) phase, E(phi) magnitude, and E(phi) phase.

This format is intended to allow efficient importing and use of antenna patterns with a wide range of programs, such as Matlab, Excel, Spyder(python), or Octave.
